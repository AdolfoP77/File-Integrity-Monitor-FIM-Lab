# File-Integrity-Monitor-FIM-Lab

In this lab we will create a File Integrity Monitor (FIM) using python, the code will check Hashes for Integrity and send an email when a file's integrity has been changed.

<br>
1.Import libraries (Hashlib).(The Python hashlib module is an interface for hashing messages easily 



2.Get the file location. (We are using a input field)
3.Create a Function to hash a file.
4.Declare Hash type. We are using md5
5.Open the file in read and binary mode.
6.Read and put the file into a variable.
7.Hash the file.
8.Return in hexadecimal mode.
9.Set baseline to be the Hash
10.Create while loop. (never stops)
11.Check files hash
12.Compare to see if it changed.
13.Make sure baseline is updated.
14.Add Email notification to notify.
